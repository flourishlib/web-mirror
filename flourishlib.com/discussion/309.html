<p>
I'm trying out flourish, so far I love it, but I'm running into some difficulty with <a href="../flourishlib.com/docs/fRecordSet.html">fRecordSet</a>.  My database is four tables in postgresql, full RI with primary and foreign keys, etc.  The tables are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>states (state_id, short_name, long_name)</li>
<li>cities (city_id, state_id, name)</li>
<li>zipcodes (zipcode_id, city_id, zipcode)</li>
<li>locations (location_id, zipcode_id, name)</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are other fields, but those are the ones related to the relations.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple cities belong to a single state; cities.state_id -FK&gt; states.state_id</li>
<li>Multiple zipcodes belong to a single city: zipcode.city_id -FK&gt; cities.city_id</li>
<li>Multiple locations belong to a single zipcode: locations.zipcode_id -FK&gt; zipcodes.zipcode_id</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="../flourishlib.com/docs/fActiveRecord.html">fActiveRecord</a> based classes exist for each table and are named appropriately, e.g.
</p>
<pre class="block php"><code>  class city extends fActiveRecord
  {
    protected function configure()
    {
    }
  }</code></pre>

<p>
 Given cities.name and state.short_name, I'm trying to find the locations that are in that city and state.  The raw SQL would be:
</p>
<pre class="block sql"><code>SELECT *
  FROM locations lo, zipcodes zi, cities ci, states st
 WHERE lo.zipcode_id = zi.zipcode_id
   AND zi.city_id = ci.city_id
   AND ci.state_id = st.state_id
   AND ci.name = 'Dover'
   AND st.short_name = 'NH'</code></pre>

<p>
 This raw SQL works as expected.
</p>

<p>
I'm having a bit of trouble coming up with the most efficient way to retrieve this data using the <a href="../flourishlib.com/docs/fActiveRecord.html">fActiveRecord</a> classes (which are defined for all the tables), and/or <a href="../flourishlib.com/docs/fRecordSet.html">fRecordSet</a> class.  Rather than go over all the obviously wrong things I've tried, can someone suggest what they would do in order to get this result?
</p>
</div>

<div class="messages">
		<div class="children">
					<div class="message" id="message-964">
				<div class="body" id="body-964">
					
<p>
Just to cover the 'most promising' attempt I've made:
</p>
<pre class="block php"><code>$state = new State(array('short_name' =&gt; strtoupper($path[1])));
$city = new City(array('name' =&gt; $path[2], 'state_id' =&gt; $state-&gt;getStateId()));
$zips = $city-&gt;buildZipcodes();
$locations = $zips-&gt;buildLocations();</code></pre>

<p>
 The exception is thrown on the last line, where it says that &quot;the table zipcodes is not in a *-to-one relationship with the table locations&quot;.  The error statement is true; zipcodes is in a 1-to-many relationship with locations
</p>

<p>
If I replace the last line with this block, it works, but seems &quot;ugly&quot; and I imagine there's a better/simpler way to do what I'm trying to do:
</p>
<pre class="block php"><code>$locations = array();
foreach ($zips as $zip)
{
  $locations[] = $zip-&gt;buildLocations();
}</code></pre>

You should be able to get the record set with the following code. Unfortunately it isn't currently possible to join three tables away using the <a href="../flourishlib.com/docs/fRecordSet.html">fRecordSet</a> syntax, so you'll either need to pre-select the state, or build from SQL.
</p>
<pre class="block php"><code>// If you short name is unique, you can do this
$state = new State(array('short_name' =&gt; 'NH'));

$set = fRecordSet::build(
    'Location',
    array(
        'zipcodes=&gt;cities.name='     =&gt; 'Dover',
        'zipcodes=&gt;cities.state_id=' =&gt; $state-&gt;getStateId()
    )
);

// Or you can do a build from SQL
$set = fRecordSet::buildFromSQL(
    'Location',
    fORMDatabase::retrieve()-&gt;escape(
        '
        SELECT lo.*
        FROM locations lo, zipcodes zi, cities ci, states st
        WHERE lo.zipcode_id = zi.zipcode_id
            AND zi.city_id = ci.city_id
            AND ci.state_id = st.state_id
            AND ci.name = %s
            AND st.short_name = %s
        ',
        'Dover',
        'NH'
    )
);</code></pre>

<p>
 It seems to me that neither of these are optimal from a syntax perspective.
</p>

<p>
The thing that is stopping me from implementing the possibility of more tables distance between tables is just the syntax. Ideally there would be slightly different syntax so that I can reliably parse it. Perhaps an additional <code>=</code> such as <code>==&gt;</code> or an additional <code>&gt;</code> such as <code>=&gt;&gt;</code>?
</p>

<p>
<a href="../flourishlib.com/api/fRecordSet.html#buildFromSQL">fRecordSet::buildFromSQL()</a> could probably benefit from a method to escape values without having to explicitly retrieve an <a href="../flourishlib.com/docs/fDatabase.html">fDatabase</a> issue.
</p>

<p>
Ideally both of these issues should be solved through enhancements.

Thanks for the quick response!
</p>

<p>
I'm trying to wrap my head around this in a way that allows <a href="../flourishlib.com/docs/fRecordSet.html">fRecordSet</a> to be built to support 'n' distance, rather than 2 or 3 or 8..
</p>

<p>
In my specific case, I'm obviously doing something 'odd', but the schema and access method isn't all that uncommon in the general case.
