I've written a mass mailer using the <a href="../docs/fSMTP.html">fSMTP</a> and <a href="../docs/fEmail.html">fEmail</a> classes and am getting acceptable performance (around 500 emails / minute).  The problem that I'm running into is that even though the emails are being generated quickly enough people aren't receiving them until hours later.
</p>

<p>
My initial thought was that if you try to send out 70,000 emails using one SMTP server at 500 emails / minute that the server just gets them all queued up and it just takes time for it to process them all.  I still think this is correct I just wanted to get some community feedback and eliminate Flourish as any source of problem.
</p>

<p>
I would hate to have to dirty up my code using !SwiftMailer or some other mass mail lib, Flourish code is just so nice and clean and consistent.

<p>
From my experience when we use to run some mass mailing stuff on some of our servers, sending 70,000 emails can easily take 4+ hours. I think if you need the messages delivered faster, you will probably need to use multiple SMTP servers, or perhaps some dedicated SMTP service that focuses on speed.
</p>

<p>
The only performance part that would be affected by the PHP side is how fast the emails get sent to the SMTP server. I have not profiled the performance of <a href="../docs/fSMTP.html">fSMTP</a> at all, so there may be ways to improve it. I did, however, implement the SMTP <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2920">PIPELINING extension</a>, which allows sending a bunch of info without waiting for confirmation for each before continuing.
</p>

<p>
Right now <a href="../docs/fEmail.html">fEmail</a> and <a href="../docs/fSMTP.html">fSMTP</a> do not try to send emails with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_SMTP#8BITMIME">8BITMIME extension</a> in the interest of compatibility. Theoretically messages sent via 8BITMIME would be faster since the size of the messages would be smaller due to a more efficient encoding.
