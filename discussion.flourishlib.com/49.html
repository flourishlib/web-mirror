<p>
where flourishlib is perfect to mix into existing projects (in my case oscommerce), i would love to see possibilty to 
</p>
<pre class="block php"><code>fORMDatabase::attach(new fDatabase('mysql', $my_mysql_connection));</code></pre>

<p>
 I mean, I already was forced to open a mysql-connection, otherwise oscommerce needs a 100% rewrite - impossible... with the existing methods, I would open a second useless db-connection, just to enable flourish-orm to talk to it.
</p>

<p>
I patched the <a href="../flourishlib.com/docs/fDatabase.html">fDatabase</a> to use my existing mysql-connection, but its no clean solution. cheers+really great work!!!

There are a few potential issues with passing in a mysql connection, which is why I don't currently support it.
</p>

<p>
First, all of Flourish uses UTF-8 everywhere, including in the database. When <a href="../flourishlib.com/docs/fDatabase.html">fDatabase</a> connects to a MySQL database, it sets the connection to use UTF-8 encoding and sets the sql mode to make MySQL act more like other databases. This may screw up !OsCommerce.
</p>

<p>
In addition, <a href="../flourishlib.com/docs/fDatabase.html">fDatabase</a> detects the extensions you have installed, however you may have multiple extensions for MySQL and it can't detect the extension via the resource, so now you would have to pass the extension in, which would mess with the API.
</p>

<p>
Finally, <a href="../flourishlib.com/docs/fDatabase.html">fDatabase</a> keeps track of transactions to ensure that transactions aren't started when they are already in progress. Doing so would cause the whole transaction to fail.
</p>

<p>
Since a connection to a local MySQL database is actually through a filesystem socket, I don't think you should be too concerned about the extra connection, unless of course this is an extremely high-traffic site.
</p>

<p>
As the class is right now, the connection parameter is private, so the class can not be extended to add a method which allows setting the connection. I would be fine with making it protected so that extending classes can use/change it. If you think this would be useful, please open a ticket.
