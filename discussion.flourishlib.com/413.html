Hi!
</p>

<p>
I have the following problem/question. I have a table 'images' and I have a table 'products', which references 'images'. My application is modularized, 'images' is in core and 'products' belongs to a module. Not all modules are loaded all the time, but the database-tables are still present.
</p>

<p>
So the problem is, if the <a href="../flourishlib.com/docs/fActiveRecord.html">fActiveRecord</a> 'Product' is not present, i can not delete an entry from 'images'. An exception (&quot;The noun specified could not be singularized&quot;) is thrown. I think this message comes from a relation check?
</p>

<p>
Is there a way to implement a &quot;clean&quot; solution for this problem? Can i override the relation check? 
</p>

<p>
Please let me know if you need some code or a database-model. Thanks for your help!
</p>

<p>
So I can definitely tell you that it is trying to load the Product class to call <code>-&gt;delete()</code> on all child records. This ensures that any delete hook callbacks get called on the children.
</p>

<p>
The message &quot;The noun specified could not be singularized&quot; is not a normal occurrence, or are you mapping table names to class names? If so, perhaps try moving your <a href="../flourishlib.com/api/fORM.html#mapClassToTable">fORM::mapClassToTable()</a> calls to your common init code.
</p>

<p>
Right now there is no way to prevent calling <code>-&gt;delete()</code> on related <a href="../flourishlib.com/docs/fActiveRecord.html">fActiveRecord</a> objects, precisely because you are (normally) going to want to execute delete hook callbacks if they exist. It is also entirely possible the related <a href="../flourishlib.com/docs/fActiveRecord.html">fActiveRecord</a> <code>-&gt;delete()</code> method has been overridden and does more than the default.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps your core should include a skeleton of all <a href="../flourishlib.com/docs/fActiveRecord.html">fActiveRecord</a> classes that can be loaded if they don't exist in a module? You could also use something like <a href="../flourishlib.com/api/fORM.html#defineActiveRecordClass">fORM::defineActiveRecordClass()</a>, but I wouldn't recommend it for production since it uses <code>eval()</code>. This technique seems like it could end up causing the wrong class/functionality to be loaded, but if you are careful to ensure a module is never disabled once database contents exist for it, it may work.

Thanks for your reply. Maybe I could include the skeletons in core, although in my opinion, this isn't the right way if trying to implement a clean modularization. The solution with <a href="../flourishlib.com/api/fORM.html#defineActiveRecordClass">fORM::defineActiveRecordClass()</a> seems a little bit cleaner to me, because it is more dynamic. Maybe I could try to override the delete-method, so i can prevent the records from being deleted. A simple exception if the image is referenced would be enough for me.
</p>

<p>
Another thought: Maybe I should explain a little bit more precise what I want to do. I don't want to cascade. I would like to prevent image from being deleted if it is referenced. Like 'ON DELETE NO ACTION' in SQL. Is there a support for defining this 'relation-type'?

<p>
Sorry for the late follow-up. If in your database you define the <code>ON DELETE</code> clause of your foreign key to be <code>ON DELETE NO ACTION</code>, Flourish will respect that. It should also give you nice error messaging if it hits that situation.
