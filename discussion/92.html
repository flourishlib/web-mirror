Hello.
</p>

<p>
I've been using the <a href="../docs/fActiveRecord.html">fActiveRecord</a> class and I really like the functionality. However when I started looking at the memory usage of my script I noticed that the <a href="../docs/fActiveRecord.html">fActiveRecord</a> object stands for a whooping 2 megabytes of memory (about half of the memory that my script uses).
</p>

<p>
Is this normal/expected? If one instance of <a href="../docs/fActiveRecord.html">fActiveRecord</a> pulls that much creating an <a href="../docs/fRecordSet.html">fRecordSet</a> could be potentially devastating memory wise.
</p>

<p>
Kindly, Marcus.

Can you give me some information about how many columns are in the table being modeled? Do you have a large database schema? The whole database schema needs to be loaded into memory to use the ORM, so if you have a large schema, that could use some memory.
</p>

<p>
At my company we have not seen any memory issues, however that doesn't mean there aren't any issues. Have you tried loading multiple records to see how the memory usage goes up?

There's 13 columns in the table. The database contains 20 tables so it's not that big (I think). Anyway the cost of about 2 megabytes of memory seems to be a constant one time cost, not something that increases as more <a href="../docs/fActiveRecord.html">fActiveRecord</a> objects are instantiated. I put in some dummy data and made an <a href="../docs/fRecordSet.html">fRecordSet</a> of them and the memory usage for that was pretty much the same.
</p>

<p>
What is the &quot;normal&quot; cost for an <a href="../docs/fActiveRecord.html">fActiveRecord</a> instantiation? Does it tend to end up in the megabyte class or are they usually smaller?
</p>

<p>
Kindly, Marcus.

Each instance of an <a href="../docs/fActiveRecord.html">fActiveRecord</a> class holds the following data:
</p>

<ul>
<li>An array of values, in the form <code>column =&gt; value</code></li>
<li>An array of array of old values, if they've changes. This is in the form <code>column =&gt; old_values_array</code>.</li>
<li>An array of cached related records. This holds references to record sets of related records that have been built. If you have a <code>User</code> and call <code>$user-&gt;buildGroups()</code> it keeps a reference to that <a href="../docs/fRecordSet.html">fRecordSet</a> so you can call it again without going to the database and re-fetching it. The nice thing is that by themselves <a href="../docs/fRecordSet.html">fRecordSet</a> are pretty light weight since they are mostly holding references to <a href="../docs/fActiveRecord.html">fActiveRecord</a> objects.</li>
<li>A cache array, that is completely up to the end-developer to use</li>
</ul>

<p>
For a typical <a href="../docs/fActiveRecord.html">fActiveRecord</a> that models a table not storing large text blocks or binary blobs, I would expect usage to be 1k or so. 1k is basically 1024 characters as long as you don't have a lot of multi-byte characters.
</p>

<p>
The initial 2MB memory usage is probably largely loading the Flourish classes into memory and loading the database schema into memory. Looking at a recent snapshot of Flourish, it is 2.38MB on the filesystem. Obviously a good third or so of this is comments, so the memory usage you are seeing is probably exactly that.
