First off, thank you Mr. Bond.  Flourish works well for me and have enjoyed using it over the past month.
</p>

<p>
I was curious if there were some examples of unit testing that could be provided.  Actually, it's more than unit testing as I want to &quot;test&quot; GET/POST functions for my project.  More of a transitional test.  I know I could use Selenium with PHPUnit but I want to run test pre-browser.  I thought you might have some examples that could be used as boilerplate.  Essentially, I want to test functionality w/o a browser before I test the browser.  There may be some other tools I am not aware of but thought the use of PHPUnit would be my first choice.  Make sense?  Thoughts.

<p>
I use <a href="https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/">PHPUnit</a> for Flourish and I think it is quite capable of the majority of testing requirements. I would recommend it. The only critiques I have is the upgrade process documentation and handling different PHP configurations. I had some trouble figuring out what I needed to do to upgrade my tests from 3.4 to 3.5 recently since I was using some test suite functionality that went away.
</p>

<p>
While I don't show all of the tests in the Code tab for simplicity, you can browse them at <a href="https://github.com/wbond/flourish/tree/master/tests">https://github.com/wbond/flourish/tree/master/tests</a>. My setup it probably quite a bit more complicated than what you'll need. I have a custom test runner that runs tests multiple times with different PHP ini settings to ensure I test with non-standard extensions unloaded. I also have a bash script that executes the tests remotely on the 12 different virtual machines.
