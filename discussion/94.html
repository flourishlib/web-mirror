FYI : Lots of blah blah blah, but there's a call to action at the end if your impatient.
</p>

<p>
I noticed flourish way back in January when a few blogs first mentioned it.  I was leary of frameworks and overworked at the time; so, I just lodged it in my brain for later use.  Back in March, I posted a comment on the blog (<a href="../blog/DiscussionsandComments.html">http://flourishlib.com/blog/DiscussionsandComments</a>) about my concerns with flourish and frameworks in general.  
</p>
<pre><code>However, flourish still causes me the same concerns I have with using frameworks. I'm not a php expert. 
I'd say I'm a mid-level developer. I feel that using frameworks and libraries will result in me not becoming 
a better PHP developer. In fact, I think it might cause me to become LESS skilled in PHP. When looking for jobs, 
employers generally are looking for someone that is really good at PHP. I've never seen anyone looking for 
a flourish developer and few are looking for CakePHP or CI developers.</code></pre>

<p>
 Well, how wrong I was,  I finally committed to using and learning flourish.  Because of digging around in the code and trying to figure out how to do X, I've become a MUCH better programmer in these last 4 months.  Before, I was using mostly procedural programming with the occasional classes thrown in.  However, I was doing it all wrong.  Now, I am primarily an OOP programmer and using it correctly.  I don't think I would have made this transition so quickly without digging into flourish and learning from a master developer like Will Bond.  
</p>

<p>
In addition to the great code, Will has been an amazing developer and support person.  Everyone that posts for support gets an answer.  If fact, most of the time, it's not just a suggestion or nudge in the right direction.  Will normally responds with a completely coded solution.  Amazing.
</p>

<p>
Finally - to my point.  There is very little talk of  flourish in the PHP community.  I'd like that to change.  This is an awesome non-framework that more people could benefit from.  I'm sure Will is too busy to be out spreading the word in addition to developing flourish and supporting all of us.  We users need to take action to get flourish more coverage.  So, please spread the word, vote up on Digg, Reddit, Retweet etc.   
</p>

<p>
Here are my efforts so far (please retweet and vote these up and then create some of your own)

Thanks for the kind words and your effort in promoting Flourish.
</p>

<p>
From looking at web stats and stuff it seems like a slow but steady increase in attention. From when I initially launched the beta on twitter back in November, things have slowly increased. In January I submitted Flourish to Hacker News, Reddit and Digg. Since then someone else has also submitted the site to DZone. A little over a week ago Flourish was mentioned in a !NetTuts article. Now last night you submitted it to Reddit and Digg. Each of these articles seems to increase the daily average number of visitors some.
</p>

<p>
In one sense the PHP community is hard to promote since many of the programmer-type aggregation sites seem to be full of people who really dislike PHP for any number of reasons. Another limiting factor is that many developers are solely interested in a frameworkthey don't need the flexibility and would benefit more from features such as a full stack with template helpers, a PHP-based routing system and built-in caching.
</p>

<p>
In the end it seems like getting some attention through an article or two seems to be the way to slowly attract attention. I do have a number of blogs in process that contain some good information, however with my limited free time it is hard to keep up with bug fixes, the forums and writing blogs.
</p>

<p>
In addition to promoting the project, anyone who is familiar with Flourish who feels inclined to answer questions in the forum would be most appreciated. I think one of my main interests in the Flourish &quot;community&quot; is to ensure that it is friendly and welcoming.
</p>

<p>
Thanks again!

I've proposed covering Flourish in the CodeWorks Conference here in Dallas in September.  We'll see if my local PHP User Group (DPUG) will select me.

Awesome! Please do keep me up to date about this.
</p>

<p>
I'm looking to possibly do one or two talks around the Boston area over the next few months. I'm sure I'll post a blog if anything pans out.
