<p>
So this is an idea from Silverstripe which also has a ORM system.
</p>

<p>
Let's say I have a User class which extends <a href="../docs/fActiveRecord.html">fActiveRecord</a> with the proper table set up in the database. Then if I wanted different kinds of users I would set up classes that extend User that in turn have tables set up with a one-to-one relationship to the users table via the primary key.
</p>

<p>
For example, let's say I have the tables users, company_users and private_users then I would create the classes User-&gt;<a href="../docs/fActiveRecord.html">fActiveRecord</a>, CompanyUser-&gt;User, PrivateUser-&gt;User. Ideally Flourish would handle the joins behind the scenes and even though the two child classes consist of two tables it could be treated as one through the get/set methods.
</p>

<p>
I've actually managed to get a very basic version of this set up with Flourish today by overriding <span class="underline">call() and sending along all methods to the child class which I store internally in the User class. This is of course not a really good, or I suspect, safe method so this kind of functionality would be awesome to have in Flourish.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline"> I have no idea how big of a job it would be to implement this or even if it's the way you want to be doing things but I wanted to put it out there as an idea.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
It should be possible to implement such functionality using the plugin architecture, in the same way as <a href="../docs/fORMCOlumn.html">fORMCOlumn</a>, <a href="../docs/fORMMoney.html">fORMMoney</a>, <a href="../docs/fORMOrdering.html">fORMOrdering</a>, etc. You would basically need to reflect the parent object to get all of the applicable column-based method names, and proxy them. Then you'd have to implement custom load(), store(), validate(), etc that would call those methods on both objects.
</p>

<p>
This is how I would probably implement it, I just don't know when I'd be able to get to it. The only other thing to consider is issues where the two tables share column names. I imagine such databases would just not be supported.

<p>
Ok so I have been trying out the plugin architecture with my current implementation in an effort to learn how all of this works and to see if I could make the functionality that I wrote in one class reusable as a plugin.
</p>

<p>
However when I read the code in <a href="../docs/fActiveRecord.html">fActiveRecord</a> I realized that the <span class="underline">call method matches the callback to the raw $method_name and not the $action. Would it be possible to check for both or would that slow things down too much?</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline"> What I'm after is the ability to override all calls to get/set not just specific calls to, for example getId.</span>

Ok so I'm pretty much finished with my rather weird implementation and overall everything worked great. The only thing lacking for me is a callback for post::loadFromIdentityMap(). If the following could be added to loadFromIdentityMap()
</p>
<pre class="block php"><code>fORM::callHookCallbacks(
	$this,
	'post::loadFromIdentityMap()',
	$this-&gt;values,
	$this-&gt;old_values,
	$this-&gt;related_records,
	$this-&gt;cache,
	$object
);</code></pre>

<p>
 It would give me a chance to modify the returned object. Right now the object that's returned is &quot;bare bones&quot; so to speak so if I've added my own properties to my <a href="../docs/fActiveRecord.html">fActiveRecord</a> classes they won't get returned when loadFromIdentityMap() is used. With this callback I would get the chance to make those modifications. I've tried adding it and it works.
