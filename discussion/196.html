<p>
I discovered flourish yesterday when i was (again) looking for a nice framework,  because i have a new job and don't want to build all the basic stuff again. Cakephp or Zend FW are to big or overly complicated for my new job.   I really like the motivations behind this (un)framework and the code looks well structured from what i seen so far. Especially the ORM, it looks pretty cool and certainly a lot less complicated as Doctrine, so i am ready to sink my teeth into flourish!
</p>

<p>
Which leads to my suggestion, a download of the documentation would be nice. Mainly because i don't have an Internet connection all the time and secondly because i like to 'have' it locally.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for releasing this !

I have had a few requests for a PDF of the documentation, I've just never had enough time to figure out a solution. I'm thinking some use of wget would probably allow me to pull down all of the docs from /docs/ and /api/, it would then just require writing some scripts to pull out the unimportant parts of the pages, restyle it and create either an offline HTML zip or PDF or something.
</p>

<p>
I can't really say when I'll have time to do this - time is pretty tight with maintaining Flourish, my day job and my family.
